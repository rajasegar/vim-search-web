INTRODUCTION                                    *vim-search-web*

Developers often want to lookup something from their source code.
And the search is not simply through Google, so this plugin helps
you to search about a keyword from multiple sources like Stack Overflow,
Github, npm, etc.,

COMMANDS                                        *vim-search-web-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).
